# Virtuoso-Engine
Virtuoso Engine is a collection of libraries for 3D game development in C++ without using an off the shelf game engine.

It is intended for people who are comfortable with game development in native C++, but includes several domain specific languages for particular tasks.

Imagine something like RayLib, but oriented towards C++ instead of C, and 3D instead of 2D.
